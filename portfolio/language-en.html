            </p>
            <p class="text">
                In high school, I studied photographic design, where for the first two years we mainly focused on
                analog photography and the entire process from taking pictures to developing film and photographs in a darkroom.
                Later, we also devoted ourselves to digital photography in and outside the studios. I went through
                digital editing of photos in Adobe Photoshop and creating graphic designs. At the moment, I have 
                photography as a hobby, where I experiment in different areas, but I mainly focus on event photography
                and photography of concerts and festivals. I am currently retraining in the IT field, where I started
                a few months ago as a self-taught person and I have completed a few courses of automated testing via 
                Selenide/Selenium. Since I was more fascinated by creating websites, I decided to switch from testing
                to creating websites in HTML. I'm like that because after hours of sitting at the PC and writing code, 
                I can see some kind of result behind me, and that's exactly why I enjoy it, and I'm more and more
                motivated. I plan to continue my education in IT, as I enjoy it very much and I want to continue with
                other opportunities and industries that this sector offers.
